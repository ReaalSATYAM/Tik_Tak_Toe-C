The game displays the Tic-Tac-Toe board and prompts each player to input their move by choosing a number corresponding to the cell they want to mark.

Example Board:

```bash
[ TIC-TAC-TOE ]

  1  |  2  |  3      Player 1 - X 
_____|_____|_____
     |     |
  4  |  5  |  6      Player 2 - O
_____|_____|_____
     |     |
  7  |  8  |  9
     |     |
```
